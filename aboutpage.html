	<h1>About the Project</h1>
	<h3>Hiding in Plain Sight: A Columbia Missourian Special Project</h3>

	<p id="text-about">At the close of 2018, a curious photo editor wanted to know where the Columbia Missourian had been sending photographers and videographers throughout the year. She generated a map from her research and found there were neighborhoods in Columbia where staff was seldom sent. We wanted to correct ourselves. Since January 2019, visual journalists have been sent to these areas to get to know locals and amplify their voices. These are a few of many stories.</p>
	<p id="text-about">The above video is an introduction to the project and the photo stories that are seen on this website. The video is a collaborative effor from those involved in the project and was partially filmed and totally edited and produced by Phoebe Mussman. </p>
	<p id="text-about">Displayed below is a map featuring all of the trax requests by locaation that were received by the Missourian Photo Department in 2018. It is important to note that the dots placed on the map may be stacked on top of each other. For example, high schools where we recieve multiple assignments have multiple dots stacked on top of each other that aren't visible through this presentation. The larger, yellow points mark the locations of the five stories created for the Hiding in Plain Sight Project, located in areas where minimal other coverage had occured.</p>
