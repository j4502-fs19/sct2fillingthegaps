	<h3 id="h3">Hiding in Plain Sight: A Columbia Missourian Special Project</h3>
	<p id="text">At the close of 2018, a curious photo editor wanted to know where the Columbia Missourian had been sending photographers and videographers throughout the year. She generated a map from her research and found there were neighborhoods in Columbia where staff was seldom sent. We wanted to correct ourselves. Since January 2019, visual journalists have been sent to these areas to get to know locals and amplify their voices. These are a few of many stories.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p id="text">The following video is an introduction to the project and the photo stories that are seen on this website. The video is a collaborative effor from those involved in the project and was partially filmed and totally edited and produced by Phoebe Mussman. NOTE: We removed the video for now because it is too large for github to push. Will embed link when it publishes this week to save size.</p>
