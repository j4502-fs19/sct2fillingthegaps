			<figcaption id="text">Kelin Cobbins has his mind set on the Los Angeles music industry. Whether producing his own freestyle songs or curating a thematic album about his childhood and roots, Cobbins is determined.<br><br>

"I eat, sleep, listen to music and go to work so I can make music and get to LA," Cobbins said. "I need to live there and just breath music."<br><br>

Being raised by his grandmother and uncles in Columbia, Cobbins says he feels an anchor in his hometown. When he drives around Columbia, he says he feels "a feeling of love and life."<br><br>

Cobbins constantly surrounds himself with the essence of music and searches for a new edge to his music through rising artists, local performances and more mainstream music. <br><br>


While working the night shift at a local nursing home and taking care of his children who often come to Columbia to visit, Cobbins has a full plate. Although he was born in Columbia and raised by various family members around town, all Cobbins can think of is the west coast.
